	// All it does is hold the name of the app, the version,
	// the name of the engine, and the version, it literally
	// does not do or change anything in the program, so I 
	// just ignore it

	// It is time to talk about another pattern that 
	// will be used in all over the Vulkan program.

	// When we create the structure VkInstanceCreateInfo,
	// we will give it an "sType" that is ALWAYS equal 
	// to VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_INSTANCE_CREATE_INFO.

	// Some people wonder "what is the point of having the
	// ability to change sType if it should always be the 
	// same anyways?"

	// Here is why: Eventually, we will take our object
	// of VkInstanceCreateInfo, which in this case is 
	// called "inst_info", and we will pass it to the
	// function "vkCreateInstance". When we do that,
	// we will give it a pointer to inst_info.

	// vkCreateInstance will check to see if the
	// first four bytes of the pointer is equal to 
	// VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_INSTANCE_CREATE_INFO. If it
	// is equal, then that means we passed the correct
	// pointer to the function, which is "inst_info".
	// If vkCreateInstance does not see "VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_INSTANCE_CREATE_INFO",
	// then that means the programmer might have made
	// a mistake, by giving the wrong poniter to the
	// vkCreateInstance function, and then the validation
	// layer will print an error in the command prompt window
	// that we made a mistake.

	// Therefore, the reason why every Vk---CreateInfo
	// structure has sType, is to help us make sure that
	// we are not making mistakes. If you do not understand this
	// then please read the commments again, this will
	// be a pattern that is seen throughout the entire tutorial

	// Also, the reason why Vulkan has structures for "create Info",
	// is so that we can pass the structure as one parameter,
	// rather than passing all of these variables as seperate
	// parameters. Some DirectX 11 functions like D3DCreateDeviceAndSwapchain,
	// have 10 parameters, and Vulkan puts the parameters into a structure,
	// to make the code look more organized

	// differences

	// In Khronos' textured cube sample, they have two queues, one for
	// command buffers, and one for sending images to the screen. This
	// is not a good habit to have, because AMD GPUs only support one queue,
	// and performance is usually better with one queue, than multiple.
	// The Khronos tutorial also does not use staging buffers correctly,
	// it makes one staging buffer for an array of textures, where one 
	// buffer overwrites the other, causing memory leaks (more on that later)

	// Before writing this tutorial, I spoke to a Vulkan expert, who goes
	// by the name of Exzap, he is the lead Vulkan programmer for the 
	// Cemu project (Wii U emulator). He says that if multiple queues were
	// used, then "any performance gain will be ruined by synchronization
	// overhead from using multiple queues", so we will stick to one queue.

	//			If you are new to graphics APIs
	//			Here is an explaination of a swapchain:
	//			What it does, and why we need it
	//
	// Lets pretend that Vulkan can render to the screen, and only
	// to the screen. That would mean that Vulkan would have to draw each pixel
	// on the screen, and then delete every pixel on the screen, and then start
	// rendering the next image to the screen. This is slow.
	// With a swapchain, we can have two images. When we first initialize Vulkan,
	// both swapchain images will be blank. Then, Vulkan will draw an image to one
	// of the swapchain images. After that, the completed image can be sent to the
	// monitor, while the 2nd swapchain image is being rendered. Then, after the 1st
	// image is done drawing on the screen and after the 2nd image is fully rendered,
	// they swap, which is why it is called "swapchain". Then, the 2nd image is being
	// drawn on the screen, while VUlkan is rendering a new frame to the 1st swapchain
	// image. Some swapchains have 2 images, and some have 3 images.

	// If a swapchain is so important, some might wonder why it is only available in an
	// extension (as discussed in a previous function), rather than being a core feature 
	// of Vulkan. Truthfully, not all Vulkan softwares use a swapchain, and not all GPUs 
	// support swapchains. Some Vulkan GPUs don't support graphics at all, and those will
	// Vulkan only for Compute, but those GPUs are your typical gaming cards.

	// Swapchains are an abolute standard for the gaming industry. Even the 
	// PlayStation 1 had the ability to use a swapchain, so I can guarrantee that any
	// popular consumer-level graphics card will support the swapchain extension.

	// Before we start making a new swapchain,
	// make a backup of the current swapchain.
	
	// If the swapchain is currently NULL
	// (during first init), then that's fine, 
	// the oldSwapchain will be NULL too. Otherwise
	// thd oldSwapchain will be a valid backup.

	// Part 2: Get the present mode
	//=======================================================

	// We need to find a "Present Mode" that the surface supports. A "Present mode"
	// tells the surface and the window how to handle the images that we give it.
	// There are only 4 or 5 present modes that exist. Here is a list of them:

	//		Here is an explaination of what other present modes do
	//		The one that we use in this tutorial is FIFO

	// FIFO stands for First-in, FIrst-out
	// The PRESENT_MODE_FIFO present mode will give us VSYNC, and it will 
	// prevent tearing, so it will wait until one image is fully drawn
	// on the screen, before we try to draw another image.

	// IMMEDIATE will start drawing one frame to the screen,
	// even if another image is in the middle of being drawn, causes tearing.
	// VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR is for applications that don't care about
	// tearing, or have some way of synchronizing their rendering with the
	// display.

	// MAILBOX_KHR will disable VSYNC, and uncap the 60fps limit,
	// or whatever the limit of the monitor is.
	// VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR may be useful for applications that
	// generally render a new presentable image every refresh cycle, but are
	// occasionally early.  In this case, the application wants the new image
	// to be displayed instead of the previously-queued-for-presentation image
	// that has not yet been displayed.

	// VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR is for applications that generally
	// render a new presentable image every refresh cycle, but are occasionally
	// late. In this case (perhaps because of stuttering/latency concerns),
	// the application wants the late image to be immediately displayed, even
	// though that may mean some tearing.

	// This is the number of present modes are supported 
	// by the surface and the GPU. It is zero by default
	uint32_t presentModeCount = 0;
	
	// we get the number of modes that are supported
	fpGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR(gpu, surface, &presentModeCount, NULL);

	// we make an array to hold the list of supported modes
	VkPresentModeKHR *presentModes = new VkPresentModeKHR[presentModeCount];

	// Finally, we get the list of supported modes,
	// we use a function pointer that we got from the instance,
	// this function is built-in to the driver, not the SDK.

	// currentPresentMode is a member of the Demo class,
	// it is the presentation mode that is currently active.

	// mode will be NULL (0), because there is no current
	// mode. Otherwise, That currentPresentMode will have the value
	// that it was given the last time this function was called,
	// which is the mode that is currently active
